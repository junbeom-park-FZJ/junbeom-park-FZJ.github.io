## Introduction

> As a material engineer, I have interests on improving the material and process via **investigating the fundamental mechanisms**.

- My experience began from **material synthesis** (carbon nanotube fiber via floating catalyst method) and **material analysis** (morphology, structural arrangement, crystallinity and mechanical properties). 
- After that, I shifted to the **in-situ TEM technique**, which enables to investigate the variety of material's properties (ex. phase, crystallinity, composition) or process (ex. agglomeration, electrodeposition) related to environmental conditions (ex. temperature, gas pressure, electricity). 
- Additionally, I started python based **image processing** (ex. segmentation, edge detection) to extract more information from various electron microscopy data (ex. in-situ video, Tomography, 4D STEM).
